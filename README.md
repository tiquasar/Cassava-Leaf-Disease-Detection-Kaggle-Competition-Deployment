This repository contains an initial deployment project code for cassava leaf disease detection competition hosted on github.
Steps to run:

Note: Trained Model files can be downloaded from Releases Ssection.

Some Quick Points:
1.) The trained models used here are for demo and don't have a very good accuracy , I will be soon updating code and models used by me during competition.
2.) This Initial Project Deployment is demo and is a work in progress.
