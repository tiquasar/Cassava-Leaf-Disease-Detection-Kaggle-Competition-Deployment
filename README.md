# Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Kaggle-Competition-Deployment
This repository contains an initial deployment project code for cassava leaf disease detection competition hosted on github.<br>
Steps to run:<br>
1.) Install Streamlit locally.<br>
2.) streamlit run [path to directory]\main_app.py [ARGUMENTS]<br>
Note: Trained Model files can be downloaded from Releases Ssection.<br>

Some Quick Points:<br>
<p>1.) The trained models used here are for demo and don't have a very good accuracy , soon I will be updating code and machine learning models used by me during competition.</p>
<p>2.) This Initial Project Deployment is demo and is a work in progress with sole purpose for understanding machine learning model deployment</p>
